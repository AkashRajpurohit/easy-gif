## Motivation 💪

Simple utility service which helps me save ~5 seconds for every time I want to send a GIF to communicate with someone.

> These numbers adds up pretty quickly if you are a heavy GIF user as well. 👀

It uses Tenor GIF API to fetch the relevant GIF based on text search and returns the GIF image directly as the API response (not the URL).

You can self host it easily using Cloudflare Workers, see [deployment](#deployment-%EF%B8%8F) section below for more details.

## Endpoint 🚀

- `${HOST_URL}/${my awesome text}` -> pass the text in URL format after slash.

	For example -> `https://example.com/bongo-cat`. Replace `example.com` with whatever your self hosted worker host name is.

## Deployment ☁️

Self hosting this is pretty straight forward, there are two ways.

The simplest way is to use the "Deploy to Workers" button and deploy the current version of service on your Cloudflare account.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/easy-gif)

Another way is to [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) under your own Github account which will run the `deploy-to-cf` Github action workflow.

This workflow requires some environment variables so make sure add those. These are:

- `CF_API_TOKEN` -> This is your Cloudflare API token which has permissions for Worker scripts.

	Add the API tokens from [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` -> This would be your Cloudflare Account ID.

Once these are added, run the workflow and you should see the service being deployed on Cloudflare workers.

Take the worker URL and start sending GIFs 🎉
